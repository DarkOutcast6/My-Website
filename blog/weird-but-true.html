  <h3 class="article weirdButTrue">Kelvin</h3>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">Kelvin is primarily used for scientific purposes, though it not only measures temperature but, strangely, colors. Water freezes at 273.15 K and boils at 373.15 K. It is best not to use the degrees symbol, but the letter ‚ÄúK‚Äù to symbolize a measurement in Kelvin, so it is not confused with other temperature measurements, such as Fahrenheit and Celsius.</span>
  <br>
  <h3 class="article weirdButTrue">Bigger Than a Ton!?</h3>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">The three most common measurements greater than a ton are megatons, gigatons and kilotons, gigaton being the largest and kilotons the smallest. All three of which are mainly used for measuring solar masses and/or large masses of TNT. A kiloton is equal to a unit of explosive power equal to 1,000 tons of TNT. Megatons are one million tons of TNT. Finally, a gigaton is equal to one billion tons of explosive power from TNT. If you ever need to blow something up, you probably need to know this.</span>
  <br>
  <h3 class="article weirdButTrue">I Want Metric!</h3>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">Why hasn't the United States adopted the more realistic Metric system? That's a question often pondered by American citizens. The main reason why is because of time and money. Businesses didn't want to go through the hassle of updating their systems and due to this, the bill was not passed. Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of stupid, but it‚Äôs not changing anytime soon ‚Äì sorry Americans! Surprisingly, the US had actually announced that they would be switching to the Metric system, but on the set date, nothing changed? It‚Äôs going to be a while (if ever) until the US realizes the smart decision.</span>

  <h3 class="article weirdButTrue">Strange Phobias</h3>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">Moo! Did you know people who suffer from boanthropy believe they are a cow and will try to live their life as a cow? Or that Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words? Well, many strange disorders and phobias are distributed throughout the world! Some strange phobias are as follows.</span>
  <ul class="article weirdButTrue">
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Phobophobia ‚Äì The fear of phobias, or the fear of fear</li>
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Panphobia ‚Äì The literal fear of everything</li>
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Arachibutyrophobia ‚Äì The fear of peanut butter sticking to your mouth</li>
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Zemmiphobia ‚Äì The fear of big rats</li>
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Ergophobia ‚Äì The fear of working</li>
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Bananaphobia ‚Äì The fear of bananas</li>
    <li class="article weirdButTrue">Trypophobia ‚Äì The fear of holes</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">But why do  we humans suffer from strange phobias? The most common reason is from experiences, such as a bad experience in an enclosed space or being in a car in a severe car crash. These experiences make humans often scared, and can eventually develop into severe phobias.</span>
  <br>
  <h3 class="article weirdButTrue">Conclusion</h3>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">All in all, the human race can be pretty strange. We tend to invent unnecessary and partly annoying things, but it‚Äôs just who we are.</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="article weirdButTrue">Nothing we can do really do about it ‚Äì it‚Äôs just who we are! ü§∑</span>
